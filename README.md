## A High School Passion Project

This system was born in 11th grade computer science class when I wondered:
"Can technology help balance technology itself?"

### 🔍 How It Started
- 💻 Basic Python knowledge from school curriculum

- 🧠 Curiosity about facial recognition technology

- 👪 Seeing friends struggle with gaming habits

- 🕹️ Personal interest in game development

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Self-learned Tkinter GUI development through YouTube tutorials

- Studied OpenCV documentation for basic webcam integration

### Phase 2: Challenges

- Struggled with face recognition accuracy

- Studied File Handling Thoroghly

- Learned about pandas and face_recogniton library

### Phase 3: Breakthrough

- Successfully integrated facial auth with GUI (3am eureka moment!)

- Created first working prototype after 1 week

- Tested with classmates' faces for effectiveness

### Computer Science principles:

- Data Management

- File handling operations

- Exception handling

"This project taught me that real learning happens when
textbooks meet real-world problems." - Student Developer

### 🌱 What I Gained
- 🐍 Advanced Python proficiency

- 🔍 Practical AI implementation skills

- ⏱️ Time management between studies and coding

- 🧩 Problem-solving through iterative development

- 📦 First experience with full project lifecycle

## _P.S. Special thanks to my computer teacher [Mr. Avinash Chouhan]() who encouraged experimenting beyond syllabus!





## 🌟 Key Features
- **👦 Facial Recognition Authentication** - Secure access control
- **⏳ Parent-Controlled Time Limits** - Daily gaming allowance system
- **🚫 Automatic Playlock** - Immediate session termination
- **📊 Usage Tracking** - Detailed playtime logs
- **🐍 Classic Snake Game** - Built-in demo game
- **🔒 Local Data Storage** - JSON configuration file
- **👦 Speaks for User** - Built using pyttsx3


## 🚀 Installation Guide  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8+  
- Webcam (for facial recognition)  

### Setup Instructions  
```bash  
# Clone repository  
git clone https://github.com/siddhant385/GameAddiction.git  
cd GameAddiction  

# Install dependencies  
pip install -r Installers/req.txt  

```

## 📖 How It Works
### Facial Authentication:

- Real-time face recognition using OpenCV and face-recognition library

- Compares with registered parent/child profiles

### Time Management:

- Tracks active gaming sessions

- Forces shutdown when limit reached

### Gaming Interface:

- Built-in snake game demonstration
